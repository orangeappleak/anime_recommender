One hot summer day, his childhood friend, Meiko \"Menma\" Honma, appears and pesters him to grant a forgotten wish. He pays her no mind, which annoys her, but he doesn't really care. After all, Menma already died years ago. At first, Jinta thinks that he is merely hallucinating due to the summer heat, but he is later on convinced that what he sees truly is the ghost of Menma. Jinta and his group of childhood friends grew apart after her untimely death, but they are drawn together once more as they try to lay Menma's spirit to rest. Re-living their pain and guilt, will they be able to find the strength to help not only Menma move on—but themselves as well?  \n","0  In times of need, if you look in the right place, you just may see a strange telephone number scrawled in red.

Now Akatsuki, the mysterious organization of elite rogue ninja, is closing in on their grand plan which may threaten the safety of the entire shinobi world. Although Naruto is older and sinister events loom on the horizon, he has changed little in personality—still rambunctious and childish—though he is now far more confident and possesses an even greater determination to protect his friends and home. Come whatever may, Naruto will carry on with the fight for what is important to him, even at the expense of his own body, in the continuation of the saga about the boy who wishes to become Hokage.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>22777</td>\n","      <td>Dragon Ball Z Kai:The Final Chapters</td>\n","      <td>[[0.9826013217843533]]</td>\n","      <td>[Action, Adventure, Comedy, Super Power, Martial Arts, Fantasy, Shounen]</td>\n","      <td>mastered version of the Majin Buu saga that adheres more to the manga's story.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["      ID                                  Name              Similarity  \\\n","0  30694                     Dragon Ball Super  [[0.9872989858691285]]   \n","1    269                                Bleach  [[0.9866078205394893]]   \n","2     20                                Naruto  [[0.9851681245806119]]   \n","3   1735                      Naruto:Shippuden  [[0.9847006910057859]]   \n","4  22777  Dragon Ball Z Kai:The Final Chapters  [[0.9826013217843533]]   \n","\n","                                                                      Genre  \\\n","0  [Action, Adventure, Comedy, Super Power, Martial Arts, Fantasy, Shounen]   \n","1           [Action, Adventure, Comedy, Super Power, Supernatural, Shounen]   \n","2           [Action, Adventure, Comedy, Super Power, Martial Arts, Shounen]   \n","3           [Action, Adventure, Comedy, Super Power, Martial Arts, Shounen]   \n","4  [Action, Adventure, Comedy, Super Power, Martial Arts, Fantasy, Shounen]   \n","\n","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Synopsis  \n","0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Seven years after the events of Dragon Ball Z , Earth is at peace, and its people live free from any dangers lurking in the universe.

Disturbed by a prophecy that he will be defeated by a \"Super Saiyan God,\" Beerus and his angelic attendant Whis start searching the universe for this mysterious being. Before long, they reach Earth where they encounter Gokuu Son, one of the planet's mightiest warriors, and his similarly powerful friends.  \n","1  Ichigo Kurosaki is an ordinary high schooler—until his family is attacked by a Hollow, a corrupt spirit that seeks to devour human souls. It is then that he meets a Soul Reaper named Rukia Kuchiki, who gets injured while protecting Ichigo's family from the assailant. To save his family, Ichigo accepts Rukia's offer of taking her powers and becomes a Soul Reaper as a result. However, as Rukia is unable to regain her powers, Ichigo is given the daunting task of hunting down the Hollows that plague their town. However, he is not alone in his fight, as he is later joined by his friends—classmates Orihime Inoue, Yasutora Sado, and Uryuu Ishida—who each have their own unique abilities. As Ichigo and his comrades get used to their new duties and support each other on and off the battlefield, the young Soul Reaper soon learns that the Hollows are not the only real threat to the human world.  \n","2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            oments prior to Naruto Uzumaki's birth, a huge demon known as the Kyuubi, the Nine-Tailed Fox, attacked Konohagakure, the Hidden Leaf Village, and wreaked havoc.

With the help of their now willing club advisor Suzuka Takinami, the group's goal gradually becomes achievable as they begin to grasp the foundations of good music and refine their koto-playing abilities, with the suggestion of performing more often to gain what they lack most—experience. However, as their journey to nationals is underway, the koto club members face challenges that obstruct their focus and progress. Not only does the threat of other powerhouse schools and musicians remain, but the high school issues of budding romance and soon-to-be-graduating seniors also begin to push the limits of the determined group of teenagers and the future of the koto club.  \n","1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Haruki Kitahara's light music club is on the verge of disbanding.
